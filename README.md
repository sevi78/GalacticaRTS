this is a hobby project, not professional. I love to code, even if it sometimes too complicated for my brain capacity :)
feel free to test it out! but it is still far away from finished.
Would be nice, if someone like to join the project or give some feedback.

**GameConcept:**

build cities, metrolopes to enhance your population.

**Done so far:**

- building system, building editor, several editors for many purposes
